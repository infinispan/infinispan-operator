                                source IP and avoids a second hop for LoadBalancer
                                and Nodeport type services, but risks potentially
                                imbalanced traffic spreading. "Cluster" obscures the
                                client source IP and may cause a second hop to another
                                node, but should have good overall load-spreading.

                                has a preference for a particular IP family (e.g.
                                IPv4 vs. IPv6).  If a specific IP family is requested,
                                the clusterIP field will be allocated from that family,
                                if it is available in the cluster.  If no IP family
                                is requested, the cluster's primary IP family will
                                be used. Other IP fields (loadBalancerIP, loadBalancerSourceRanges,
                                externalIPs) and controllers which allocate external
                                load-balancers should use the same IP family.  Endpoints
                                for this Service will be of this family.  This field
                                is immutable after creation. Assigning a ServiceIPFamily
                                not available in the cluster (e.g. IPv6 in IPv4 only
                                cluster) is an error condition and will fail during
                                clusterIP assignment.
