= Replicating data across clusters in multiple sites

[role="_abstract"]
Ensure availability with {ispn_operator} by configuring geographically distributed clusters as a unified service.

You can configure clusters to perform cross-site replication with:

* Connections that {ispn_operator} manages.
* Connections that you configure and manage.

[NOTE]
====
You can use both managed and manual connections for {brandname} clusters in the same `Infinispan` CR.
You must ensure that {brandname} clusters establish connections in the same way at each site.
