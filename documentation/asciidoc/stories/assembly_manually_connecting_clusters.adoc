= Manually Connecting {brandname} Clusters
Specify hostnames and ports so {brandname} clusters can establish connections with backup locations and form cross-site views.
You can manually configure connections for cross-site replication so {brandname} clusters running on {openshiftshort} can back up to clusters running in different environments, such as virtual machine or bare-metal deployments.
Manually configuring connections for cross-site replication is also necessary when access to the Kubernetes API is not available outside the {openshiftshort} cluster where {brandname} runs.
