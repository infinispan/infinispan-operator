= Setting Up Cross-Site Replication
Cross-site replication allows you to back up data from one {brandname} cluster to another.

To set up cross-site replication, you configure {ispn_operator} to automatically discover and manage connections between {brandname} clusters or manually specify the network locations for backup locations.

[NOTE]
====
You can use both automatic and manual connections for {brandname} clusters in the same `Infinispan` CR.
However, you must ensure that {brandname} clusters establish connections in the same way at each site.
