= Configuring Cross-Site Replication
Set up cross-site replication to back up data between {brandname} clusters
running in different locations.

For example, you use {ispn_operator} to manage a {brandname} cluster at a
data center in London, **LON**. At another data center in New York City,
**NYC**, you also use {ispn_operator} to manage a {brandname} cluster. In
this case, you can add **LON** and **NYC** as backup locations for each other.
