= Anti-Affinity Strategies
Each {brandname} node in a cluster runs in a pod that runs on an {k8s} node in a cluster.
Each {openshift} node runs on a physical host system.
Anti-affinity works by distributing {brandname} nodes across {k8s} nodes, ensuring that your {brandname} clusters remain available even if hardware failures occur.

{ispn_operator} offers two anti-affinity strategies:

`kubernetes.io/hostname`:: {brandname} replica pods are scheduled on different {k8s} nodes.
`topology.kubernetes.io/zone`:: {brandname} replica pods are scheduled across multiple zones.

== Fault tolerance
Anti-affinity strategies guarantee cluster availability in different ways.

[NOTE]
====
The equations in the following section apply only if the number of {k8s} nodes or zones is greater than the number of {brandname} nodes.

.Scheduling pods on different {k8s} nodes

Provides tolerance of `x` node failures for the following types of cache:

* Replicated: `x = spec.replicas - 1`
* Distributed: `x = num_owners - 1`

.Scheduling pods across multiple zones

Provides tolerance of `x` zone failures when `x` zones exist for the following types of cache:

* Replicated: `x = spec.replicas - 1`
* Distributed: `x = num_owners - 1`

[NOTE]
====
`spec.replicas`:: Defines the number of pods in each {brandname} cluster.
`num_owners`:: Is the cache configuration attribute that defines the number of replicas for each entry in the cache.
