= Performance considerations with taking backup locations offline

[role="_abstract"]
Backup locations can automatically go offline when remote sites become unavailable.
This prevents pods from attempting to replicate data to offline backup locations, which can have a performance impact on your cluster because it results in error.

You can configure how long to wait before backup locations go offline.
One or two minutes is typically a suitable wait period.
However, you should test different wait periods and evaluate their performance impacts to determine the correct value for your deployment.

If the minimum wait time is too short then backup locations can go offline.
You then need to bring those them back online and perform state transfer operations to ensure the data is in sync.
Likewise, if the minimum wait time is too long, node CPU usage increases from failed backup attempts which can lead to performance degradation.
