= Cache Service
{cacheservice} provides a volatile, low-latency data store that dramatically
increases application response rates.

{cacheservice} nodes:

* Synchronously distribute data across the cluster to ensure consistency.
* Maintain single copies of cache entries to reduce size.
* Store cache entries off-heap and use eviction for JVM efficiency.
* Ensure data consistency with a default partition handling configuration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can create multiple cache definitions with {cacheservice} but only as
copies of the default configuration.

If you update {cacheservice} nodes with the **Infinispan** CR or update the
version, you lose all data in the cache.
