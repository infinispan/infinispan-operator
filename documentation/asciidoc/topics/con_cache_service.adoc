= Cache Service
{cacheservice} provides a volatile, low-latency data store that dramatically
increases application response rates.

{cacheservice} pods:

* Synchronously distribute data across the cluster to ensure consistency.
* Maintain single copies of cache entries to reduce size. You can replicate
data for more resiliency.
* Store cache entries off-heap and use eviction for JVM efficiency.

[NOTE]
====
You can create multiple cache definitions with {cacheservice} but only as
copies of the default configuration.

Default cache configuration for {cacheservice} pods is as follows:

[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
