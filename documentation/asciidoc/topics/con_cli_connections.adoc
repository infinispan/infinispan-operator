= Connecting with the {brandname} CLI
Use the command line interface (CLI) to connect to your {brandname} cluster and perform administrative operations.

The CLI is available as part of the server distribution, which you can run on your local host to establish remote connections to {brandname} clusters on {openshiftshort}.

[NOTE]
====
It is possible to open a remote shell to a {brandname} node and access the CLI.

However using the CLI in this way consumes memory allocated to the container, which can lead to out of memory exceptions.
