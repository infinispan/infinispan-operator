= Client connection details
Before you can connect to {brandname}, you need to retrieve the following pieces of information:

* Service hostname
* Port
* Authentication credentials, if required
* TLS certificate, if you use encryption

.Service hostnames

The service hostname depends on how you expose {brandname} on the network or if your clients are running on {k8s}.

For clients running on {k8s}, you can use the name of the internal service that {ispn_operator} creates.

For clients running outside {k8s}, the service hostname is the location URL if you use a load balancer.
For a node port service, the service hostname is the node host name.
For a route, the service hostname is either a custom hostname or a system-defined hostname.

.Ports

Client connections on {k8s} and through load balancers use port `11222`.

Node port services use a port in the range of `30000` to `60000`.
Routes use either port `80` (unencrypted) or `443` (encrypted).
