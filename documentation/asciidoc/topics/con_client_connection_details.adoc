= Client connection details

[role="_abstract"]
Client connections to {brandname} require the following information:

* Hostname
* Port
* Authentication credentials, if required
* TLS certificate, if you use encryption

.Hostnames

The hostname you use depends on whether clients are running on the same {k8s} cluster as {brandname}.

Client applications running on the same {k8s} cluster use the internal service name for the {brandname} cluster.

include::yaml/metadata_name.yaml[]
----

Client applications running on a different {k8s}, or outside {k8s}, use a hostname that depends on how {brandname} is exposed on the network.

A `LoadBalancer` service uses the URL for the load balancer.
A `NodePort` service uses the node hostname.
An {openshift} `Route` uses either a custom hostname that you define or a hostname that the system generates.

.Ports

Client connections on {k8s} and a through `LoadBalancer` service use port `11222`.

`NodePort` services use a port in the range of `30000` to `60000`.
Routes use either port `80` (unencrypted) or `443` (encrypted).
