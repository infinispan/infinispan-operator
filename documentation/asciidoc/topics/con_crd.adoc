= {brandname} Custom Resources
The {ispn_operator} adds a resource type and custom resource definition (CRD)
with recommended defaults for {brandname} pods.

You configure {brandname} pods dynamically by changing defaults and adding
custom resources.

The minimum resources to define a {brandname} cluster are as follows:

----
include::yaml_annotated/cr_minimal.yaml[]
----
<1> declares the version.
<2> sets the resource type that the {ispn_operator} uses to handle the lifecycle of {brandname} clusters.
<3> names the {brandname} cluster.
<4> sets the number of pods in the {brandname} cluster.
