= Creating {brandname} Caches
To create caches when running {brandname} on {k8s}, you should:

* Use `Cache` CR as the primary mechanism for creating caches.
* Create multiple caches at a time with {brandname} CLI if you do not use `Cache` CR.
* Access {brandname} Console and create caches in XML or JSON format as an alternative to `Cache` CR or {brandname} CLI.
* Use Hot Rod clients to create caches either programmatically or through per cache properties only if required.
