= Hot Rod clients

[role="_abstract"]
Hot Rod is a binary TCP protocol that {brandname} provides for high-performance data transfer capabilities with remote clients.

.Client intelligence

The Hot Rod protocol includes a mechanism that provides clients with an up-to-date view of the cache topology.
Client intelligence improves performance by reducing the number of network hops for read and write operations.

Clients running in the same {k8s} cluster can access internal IP addresses for {brandname} pods so you can use any client intelligence.

`HASH_DISTRIBUTION_AWARE` is the default intelligence mechanism and enables clients to route requests to primary owners, which provides the best performance for Hot Rod clients.

.`BASIC` intelligence

Hot Rod clients must use `BASIC` intelligence in the following situations:

* Connecting to {brandname} through a `LoadBalancer`, `NodePort`, or {openshiftshort} `Route`.
* Failing over to a different {k8s} cluster when using cross-site replication.

{k8s} cluster administrators can define network policies that restrict traffic to {brandname}.
In some cases network isolation policies can require you to use `BASIC` intelligence even when clients are running in the same {k8s} cluster but a different namespace.
