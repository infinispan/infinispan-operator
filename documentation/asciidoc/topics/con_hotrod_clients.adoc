= Hot Rod clients
Hot Rod is a binary TCP protocol that {brandname} provides for high-performance data transfer capabilities with remote clients.

.Client intelligence

Client intelligence refers to mechanisms the Hot Rod protocol provides so that clients can locate and send requests to {brandname} nodes.

Hot Rod clients running on {k8s} can access internal IP addresses for {brandname} nodes so you can use any client intelligence.
The default intelligence, `HASH_DISTRIBUTION_AWARE`, is recommended because it allows clients to route requests to primary owners, which improves performance.

Hot Rod clients running outside {k8s} must use `BASIC` intelligence.
