{ispn_operator} can discover {brandname} clusters running in different data centers to form global clusters.

The following diagram illustrates two separate {brandname} clusters running in New York City, **NYC**, and London, **LON** that exchange JGroups `RELAY` messages to perform cross-site replication:

Managed cross-site connections use router pods to send RELAY messages to the correct cluster.
These router pods are GossipRouter instances that keep a record of all IP addresses for pods in the cluster.

To manage cross-site connections, {ispn_operator}:

. Creates a router pod for each cluster.
. Uses the Kubernetes API to retrieve IP addresses for the `<cluster_name>-site` service at each cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{ispn_operator} in each {openshiftshort} cluster must have network access to the remote Kubernetes API.
====
+
. Provides the `<cluster_name>-site` service details to all pods that send RELAY messages for cross-site replication.

Relay pods can then connect to router pods through the `<cluster_name>-site` service and perform cross-site replication.

== How managed cross-site connections work

You configure the number of pods in each cluster that can send RELAY messages for cross-site replication with the `sites.local.maxRelayNodes` field.
Those relay pods send RELAY messages to router pods at random.
The router pods then parse the RELAY message headers to forward cross-site replication requests to the correct backup cluster.

If a router pod crashes then all relay pods send RELAY messages to any other available router pod because {ispn_operator} provides the IP addresses for all router pods to all clusters.
When this happens {k8s} automatically creates a new router pod in the cluster to handle RELAY messages.

[NOTE]
====
{brandname} clusters do not start running until {ispn_operator} discovers all backup locations that you configure.
