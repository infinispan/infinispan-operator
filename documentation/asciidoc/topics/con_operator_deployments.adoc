When you install {ispn_operator}, it extends the Kubernetes API with Custom Resources (CR) for deploying and managing {brandname} clusters on {openshift}.

To interact with {ispn_operator}, {openshiftshort} users apply Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) through the {osweb} or `oc` client.
{ispn_operator} listens for `Infinispan` CRs and automatically provisions native resources, such as StatefulSets and Secrets, in addition to any resources for your {brandname} deployment.

A single {ispn_operator} installation can manage multiple {brandname} clusters in separate namespaces.
Each time an {openshiftshort} user applies CRDs to modify the deployment, {ispn_operator} applies the changes globally to all {brandname} clusters.
