= {ispn_operator} deployments

When you install {ispn_operator}, it extends the Kubernetes API with Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for deploying and managing {brandname} clusters on {openshift}.

To interact with {ispn_operator}, {k8s} users apply Custom Resources (CRs) through the {osweb} or `{kube_client}` client.
{ispn_operator} listens for `Infinispan` CRs and automatically provisions native resources, such as StatefulSets and Secrets, that your {brandname} deployment requires.
{ispn_operator} also configures {brandname} services according to the specifications in `Infinispan` CRs, including the number of pods for the cluster and backup locations for cross-site replication.

= Cluster management

A single {ispn_operator} installation can manage multiple {brandname} clusters in separate namespaces.
Each time a user applies CRs to modify the deployment, {ispn_operator} applies the changes globally to all {brandname} clusters.

= Resource reconciliation

{ispn_operator} reconciles `Infinispan` custom resources such as the `Cache` CR with resources on your {brandname} cluster.

Bidirectional reconciliation synchronizes your CRs with changes that you make to `Infinispan` resources through the {brandname} Console, command line interface (CLI), or other client application and vice versa.
For example if you create a cache through the {brandname} Console then {ispn_operator} adds a declarative Kubernetes representation.

To perform reconciliation {ispn_operator} creates a `listener` pod in each {brandname} cluster that detects modifications for `Infinispan` resources.
