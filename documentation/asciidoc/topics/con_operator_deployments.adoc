= {ispn_operator} deployments

When you install {ispn_operator}, it extends the Kubernetes API with Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for deploying and managing {brandname} clusters on {openshift}.

To interact with {ispn_operator}, {k8s} users apply Custom Resources (CRs) through the {osweb} or `{kube_client}` client.
{ispn_operator} listens for `Infinispan` CRs and automatically provisions native resources, such as StatefulSets and Secrets, that your {brandname} deployment requires.
{ispn_operator} also configures {brandname} services according to the specifications in `Infinispan` CRs, including the number of pods for the cluster and backup locations for cross-site replication.
