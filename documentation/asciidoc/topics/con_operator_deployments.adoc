= {ispn_operator} deployments

When you install {ispn_operator}, it extends the Kubernetes API with Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for deploying and managing {brandname} clusters on {openshift}.

To interact with {ispn_operator}, {openshiftshort} users apply Custom Resources (CRs) through the {osweb} or `oc` client.
{ispn_operator} listens for `Infinispan` CRs and automatically provisions native resources, such as StatefulSets and Secrets, that your {brandname} deployment requires.
{ispn_operator} also configures {brandname} services according to the specifications in `Infinispan` CRs, including the number of pods for the cluster and backup locations for cross-site replication.

A single {ispn_operator} installation can manage multiple {brandname} clusters in separate namespaces.
Each time an {openshiftshort} user applies CRs to modify the deployment, {ispn_operator} applies the changes globally to all {brandname} clusters.
