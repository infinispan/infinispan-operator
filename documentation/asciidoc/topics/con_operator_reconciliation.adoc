= Resource reconciliation

{ispn_operator} reconciles custom resources such as the `Cache` CR with resources on your {brandname} cluster.

Bidirectional reconciliation synchronizes your CRs with changes that you make to {brandname} resources through the {brandname} Console, command line interface (CLI), or other client application and vice versa.
For example if you create a cache through the {brandname} Console then {ispn_operator} adds a declarative Kubernetes representation.

To perform reconciliation {ispn_operator} creates a `listener` pod for each {brandname} cluster that detects modifications for `Infinispan` resources.

.Notes about reconciliation

* When you create a cache through the {brandname} Console, CLI, or other client application, {ispn_operator} creates a corresponding `Cache` CR with a unique name that conforms to the Kubernetes naming policy.

* Declarative Kubernetes representations of {brandname} resources that {ispn_operator} creates with the `listener` pod are linked to `Infinispan` CRs. +
Deleting `Infinispan` CRs removes any associated resource declarations.
