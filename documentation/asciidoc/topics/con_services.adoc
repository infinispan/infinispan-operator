= Service types

[role="_abstract"]
Services are stateful applications, based on the {brandname} Server image, that provide flexible and robust in-memory data storage.

== {datagridservice}

Deploy clusters of {datagridservice} pods if you want to:

* Back up data across global clusters with cross-site replication.
* Create caches with any valid configuration.
* Add file-based cache stores to save data in a persistent volume.
* Query values across caches using the {brandname} Query API.
* Use advanced {brandname} features and capabilities.

== {cacheservice}

Deploy clusters of {cacheservice} pods if you want a volatile, low-latency data store with minimal configuration.

{cacheservice} pods:

* Automatically scale to meet capacity when data storage demands go up or down.
* Synchronously distribute data to ensure consistency.
* Replicates each entry in the cache across the cluster.
* Store cache entries off-heap and use eviction for JVM efficiency.
* Ensure data consistency with a default partition handling configuration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because {cacheservice} pods are volatile you lose all data when you apply changes to the cluster with the `Infinispan` CR or update the {brandname} version.
