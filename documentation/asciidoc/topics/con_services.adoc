= Service Types
Services are stateful applications, based on the {brandname} server image, that
provide flexible and robust in-memory data storage.

There are two service types {cacheservice} or {datagridservice}.

== {cacheservice}

Use {cacheservice} if you want {brandname} to provide a volatile, low-latency
data store that requires minimal configuration.

By default, {cacheservice} nodes:

* Synchronously distribute data across the cluster to ensure consistency.
* Maintain single copies of cache entries to reduce size.
* Store cache entries off-heap and use eviction for JVM efficiency.
* Ensure data consistency with a default partition handling configuration.

== {datagridservice}

Use {datagridservice} if you want to:

* Create caches at runtime using distributed or replicated configurations.
* Add file-based cache stores to save data in the persistent volume.
* Perform cross-site replication.
* Take advantage of advanced {brandname} capabilities such as search.
