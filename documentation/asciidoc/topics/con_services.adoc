= Service types

[role="_abstract"]
Services are stateful applications, based on the {brandname} Server image, that provide flexible and robust in-memory data storage.
{brandname} operator supports only `DataGrid` service type which deploys {brandname} clusters with full configuration and capabilities. `Cache` service type is no longer supported.

DataGrid` service type for clusters lets you:

* Back up data across global clusters with cross-site replication.
* Create caches with any valid configuration.
* Add file-based cache stores to save data in a persistent volume.
* Query values across caches using the {brandname} Query API.
* Use advanced {brandname} features and capabilities.
