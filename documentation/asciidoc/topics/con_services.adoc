[id='services-{context}']
= Service Types
Services are stateful applications, based on the {brandname} server image, that
provide flexible and robust in-memory data storage.

.{cacheservice}

Use {cacheservice} if you want a volatile, low-latency data store with minimal configuration. {cacheservice} nodes:

* Automatically scale to meet capacity when data storage demands go up or down.
* Synchronously distribute data to ensure consistency.
* Replicates each entry in the cache across the cluster.
* Store cache entries off-heap and use eviction for JVM efficiency.
* Ensure data consistency with a default partition handling configuration.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because {cacheservice} nodes are volatile you lose all data when you apply
changes to the cluster with the `Infinispan` CR or update the {brandname}
version.
====

.{datagridservice}

Use {datagridservice} if you want to:

* Back up data across global clusters with cross-site replication.
* Create caches with any valid configuration.
* Add file-based cache stores to save data in the persistent volume.
* Use {brandname} search and other advanced capabilities.
