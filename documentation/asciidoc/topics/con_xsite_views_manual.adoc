= Manually connecting {brandname} clusters

[role="_abstract"]
You can specify static network connection details to perform cross-site replication with {brandname} clusters running outside {k8s}.

Manual cross-site connections are necessary in any scenario where access to the Kubernetes API is not available outside the {k8s} cluster where {brandname} runs.

[NOTE]
====
You can use both automatic and manual connections for {brandname} clusters in the same `Infinispan` CR.
However, you must ensure that {brandname} clusters establish connections in the same way at each site.
