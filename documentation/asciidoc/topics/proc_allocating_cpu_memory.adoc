= Allocating CPU and memory

[role="_abstract"]
Allocate CPU and memory resources to {brandname} pods with the `Infinispan` CR.

[NOTE]
====
{ispn_operator} requests **1Gi** of memory from the {k8s} scheduler when creating {brandname} pods.
CPU requests are unbounded by default.
====

.Procedure

. Allocate the number of CPU units with the `spec.container.cpu` field.
. Allocate the amount of memory, in bytes, with the `spec.container.memory` field.
+
The `cpu` and `memory` fields have values in the format of `<limit>:<requests>`.
For example, `cpu: "2000m:1000m"` limits pods to a maximum of `2000m` of CPU and requests `1000m` of CPU for each pod at startup.
Specifying a single value sets both the limit and request.
+
. Apply your `Infinispan` CR.
+
If your cluster is running, {ispn_operator} restarts the {brandname} pods so changes take effect.
