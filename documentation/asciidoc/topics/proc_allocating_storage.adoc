[id='allocating-storage_{context}']
= Allocating storage resources
You can allocate storage for {datagridservice} nodes but not {cacheservice} nodes.

By default, {ispn_operator} allocates `1Gi` for the persistent volume claim.
However you should adjust the amount of storage available to {datagridservice} nodes so that {brandname} can preserve cluster state during shutdown.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If available container storage is less than the amount of available memory, data loss can occur.
====

.Procedure

. Allocate storage resources with the `spec.service.container.storage` field.
. Optionally configure the `ephemeralStorage` and `storageClassName` fields as required.

|Field
|Description

|`spec.service.container.storage`
|Specifies the amount of storage for {datagridservice} nodes.

|`spec.service.container.ephemeralStorage`
|Defines whether storage is ephemeral or permanent. Set the value to `true` to use ephemeral storage, which means all data in storage is deleted when clusters shut down or restart. The default value is `false`, which means storage is permanent.

|`spec.service.container.storageClassName`
|Specifies the name of a `StorageClass` object to use for the persistent volume claim (PVC). If you include this field, you must specify an existing storage class as the value. If you do not include this field, the persistent volume claim uses the storage class that has the `storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class` annotation set to `true`.
