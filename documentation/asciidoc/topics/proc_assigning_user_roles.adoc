= Assigning roles and permissions to users

[role="_abstract"]
Assign users with roles that control whether users are authorized to access {brandname} cluster resources.
Roles can have different permission levels, from read-only to unrestricted access.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A user named "admin" is assigned the `admin` role automatically.
A user named "deployer" is assigned the `deployer` role automatically, and so on.
====

.Procedure

. Create an `identities.yaml` file that assigns roles to users.
+
[source,yaml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::yaml/identities_authz.yaml[]
----
+
. Delete your existing authentication secret, if necessary, and then create one from `identities.yaml`.
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
$ {oc_create} delete secret connect-secret --ignore-not-found
$ {oc_create} secret generic --from-file=identities.yaml connect-secret
----
+
. If you have not already done so, specify the authentication secret with `spec.security.endpointSecretName` in your `Infinispan` CR and then apply the changes.
