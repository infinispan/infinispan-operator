= Backing up {brandname} clusters

[role="_abstract"]
Create a backup file that stores {brandname} cluster state to a persistent volume.

.Prerequisites

* Create an `Infinispan` CR of `spec.service.type: DataGrid`.
* Have some resources on your {brandname} cluster to back up.
Backups archive all resources that the Cache Manager controls, including caches, cache entries, cache templates, Protobuf schema, counters, scripts, and so on.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{brandname} backups do not provide snapshot isolation.
If a write operation occurs on a cache entry that the backup operation has already archived, that write might not be backed up.
To ensure that you archive the exact state of the cluster, make sure there are no active client connections to the cluster before you back it up.
====

.Procedure

. Create a `Backup` CR.
.. Name the `Backup` CR with the `metadata.name` field.
.. Specify the {brandname} cluster to backup with the `spec.cluster` field.

include::yaml/backup.yaml[]

+
. Add the `spec.resources` field if you only want to back up certain resources.
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::yaml/backup_resources.yaml[]

+
You can also use the `*` wildcard character to back up all resources.

----
+
. Apply your `Backup` CR.
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
$ {oc_apply_cr} my-backup.yaml
----
+
A new pod joins the {brandname} cluster and creates the backup file.
When the operation is complete, the pod leaves the cluster and logs the following message:
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
ISPN005044: Backup file created 'my-backup.zip'
----
+
The resulting backup file is stored in the `{backup_path}` directory.
+
. Run the following command to verify that the backup is successful:
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
$ {describe_backup}
