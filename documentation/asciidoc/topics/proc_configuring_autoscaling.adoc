= Configuring Automatic Scaling
If you create clusters with {cacheservice} nodes, {ispn_operator}
can automatically scale nodes up or down based on memory usage for the default
cache.

{ispn_operator} monitors default caches on {cacheservice} nodes. As you add
data to the cache, memory usage increases. When it detects that the cluster
needs additional capacity, {ispn_operator} creates new nodes rather than
eviciting entries. Likewise, if it detects that memory usage is below a certain
threshold, {ispn_operator} shuts down nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Automatic scaling works with the default cache only. If you plan to add other
caches to your cluster, you should not include the `autoscale` field in your
`Infinispan` CR. In this case you should use eviction to control the size of
the data container on each node.
====

.Procedure

. Add the `spec.autoscale` resource to your `Infinispan` CR to enable automatic scaling.
. Configure memory usage thresholds and number of nodes for your cluster with the `autoscale` field.

<1> Configures the maximum threshold, as a percentage, for memory usage on each node. When {ispn_operator} detects that any node in the cluster reaches the threshold, it creates a new node if possible. If {ispn_operator} cannot create a new node then it performs eviction when memory usage reaches 100 percent.
<2> Defines the maximum number of number of nodes for the cluster.
<3> Configures the minimum threshold, as a percentage, for memory usage across the cluster. When {ispn_operator} detects that memory usage falls below the minimum, it shuts down nodes.
<4> Defines the minimum number of number of nodes for the cluster.

. Apply the changes.
