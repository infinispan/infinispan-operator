= Configuring the Number of Owners
The number of owners controls how many copies of each cache entry are
replicated across your {brandname} cluster. The default for {cacheservice}
nodes is two, which duplicates each entry to prevent data loss.

.Procedure

. Specify the number of owners with the `spec.service.replicationFactor` resource in your **Infinispan** CR as follows:
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
spec:
  ...
  service:
    type: Cache
    replicationFactor: 3 <1>
----
+
<1> Configures three replicas for each cache entry.
+
. Apply the changes.
