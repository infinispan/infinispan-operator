= Configuring the number of owners

[role="_abstract"]
The number of owners controls how many copies of each cache entry are
replicated across your {brandname} cluster. The default for {cacheservice}
nodes is two, which duplicates each entry to prevent data loss.

.Procedure

. Specify the number of copies for each cache entry with the `spec.service.replicationFactor` field in your `Infinispan` CR.
