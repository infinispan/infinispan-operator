= Configuring the number of owners
The number of owners controls how many copies of each cache entry are
replicated across your {brandname} cluster. The default for {cacheservice}
nodes is two, which duplicates each entry to prevent data loss.

.Procedure

. Specify the number of owners with the `spec.service.replicationFactor` resource in your `Infinispan` CR as follows:
+
[source,yaml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::yaml/number_of_owners.yaml[]
----
+
. Apply the changes.
