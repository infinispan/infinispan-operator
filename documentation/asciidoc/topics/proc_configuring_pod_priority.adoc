= Configuring pod priority

[role="_abstract"]
Create one or more priority classes to indicate the importance of a pod relative to other pods.
Pods with higher priority are scheduled ahead of pods with lower priority, ensuring prioritization of pods running critical workloads, especially when resources become constrained.

.Prerequisites
* Have `cluster-admin` access to {k8s}.

.Procedure
. Define a `PriorityClass` object by specifying its name and value.
+

.high-priority.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
include::yaml/priority_class.yaml[]
----
. Create the priority class.
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
{oc_create} -f high-priority.yaml
----

. Reference the priority class name in the pod configuration.
+
.Infinispan CR
[source,yaml]
----
include::yaml/priority_class_CR.yaml[]
----
+
You must reference an existing priority class name, otherwise the pod is rejected.

. Apply the changes.
