= Manually configuring cross-site connections

[role="_abstract"]
You can specify static network connection details to perform cross-site replication with {brandname} clusters running outside {k8s}.
Manual cross-site connections are necessary in any scenario where access to the Kubernetes API is not available outside the {k8s} cluster where {brandname} runs.

.Prerequisites

* Determine a suitable expose type for cross-site replication.
* Ensure you have the correct host names and ports for each {brandname} cluster and each `<cluster-name>-site` service.
+
Manually connecting {brandname} clusters to form cross-site views requires predictable network locations for {brandname} services, which means you need to know the network locations before they are created.

.Procedure

. Create an `Infinispan` CR for each {brandname} cluster.
. Specify the name of the local site with `spec.service.sites.local.name`.
. Set the value of the `spec.service.sites.local.expose.type` field to either `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`.
. Optionally configure ports with the following fields:
+
* `spec.service.sites.local.expose.nodePort` if you use a `NodePort` service.
* `spec.service.sites.local.expose.port` if you use a `LoadBalancer` service.
+
. Provide the name and static URL for each {brandname} cluster that acts as a backup location with `spec.service.sites.locations`, for example:
+
* **LON**
+

* **NYC**

include::yaml/xsite_nyc_static.yaml[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Be sure to adjust logging categories in your `Infinispan` CR to decrease log levels for JGroups TCP and RELAY2 protocols.
This prevents a large number of log files from uses container storage.

. Configure your `Infinispan` CRs with any other {datagridservice} resources and then apply the changes.
. Verify that {brandname} clusters form a cross-site view.
.. Retrieve the `Infinispan` CR.

.. Check for the `type: CrossSiteViewFormed` condition.

.Next steps

If your clusters have formed a cross-site view, you can start adding backup locations to caches.
