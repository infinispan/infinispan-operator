= Creating Routes to Services
If you are running a local {k8s} cluster with a development environment such as
`crc` you can create a route to the default service instead of creating an
external service.

.Procedure

* Hot Rod clients must use encryption, in which case you can create a route
with `passthrough` encryption as follows:
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
$ oc create route passthrough --service={example_crd_name}
----

* HTTP clients can access the REST endpoint through unencrypted routes, in which
case you can expose the default service as follows:
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
$ oc expose svc/{example_crd_name}
----
