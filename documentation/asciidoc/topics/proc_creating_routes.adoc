= Creating Routes to Services
In some cases, such as running local {k8s} clusters, you need to create routes
to access {brandname} clusters from clients running outside {k8s}.

[NOTE]
====
You create routes to services. For convenience, you should create a route to
the default service instead of creating an external service and then creating a
route to that.
====

.Procedure

* If you are not using TLS encryption, expose the default service as in the
following example:
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
$ oc expose svc/{example_crd_name}
----

* If you are using TLS encryption, create a route with `passthrough` encryption
as in the following example:
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
$ oc create route passthrough --service={example_crd_name}
----
