= Creating service account tokens

[role="_abstract"]
Generate service account tokens on each {openshiftshort} cluster that acts as a backup location.
Clusters use these tokens to authenticate with each other so {ispn_operator} can create a cross-site replication service.

.Procedure

. Log in to an {openshiftshort} cluster.
. Create a service account.
+
For example, create a service account at **LON**:
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
$ {oc_create} sa lon
serviceaccount/lon created
----
+
. Add the view role to the service account with the following command:
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
$ oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:lon
----
+
. Repeat the preceding steps on your other {openshiftshort} clusters.
