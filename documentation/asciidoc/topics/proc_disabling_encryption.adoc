= Disabling Encryption
You can disable encryption so clients do not need TLS certificates to establish connections with {brandname}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not disable encryption if endpoints are accessible from outside the {k8s} cluster via `spec.expose.type`.
====

.Procedure

* Set `None` as the value for the `spec.security.endpointEncryption.type` field in your `Infinispan` CR and then apply the changes.
