= Disabling encryption
You can disable encryption so clients do not need TLS certificates to establish connections with {brandname}.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not disable encryption if endpoints are accessible from outside the {k8s} cluster via `spec.expose.type`.
You should disable encryption for development environments only.
