= Downloading code artifacts

[role="_abstract"]
Add your artifacts to an HTTP or FTP server so that {ispn_operator} downloads them to the `{lib_path}` directory on each {brandname} node.

When downloading files, {ispn_operator} can automatically detect the file type.
{ispn_operator} also extracts archived files, such as `zip` or `tgz`, to the filesystem after the download completes.

[NOTE]
====
Each time {ispn_operator} creates a {brandname} node it downloads the artifacts to the node.
The download also occurs when {ispn_operator} recreates nodes after terminating them.

.Prerequisites

* Host your code artifacts on an HTTP or FTP server.

.Procedure

. Add the `spec.dependencies.artifacts` field to your `Infinispan` CR.
.. Specify the location of the file to download via `HTTP` or `FTP` as the value of the `spec.dependencies.artifacts.url` field.
.. Optionally specify a checksum value to verify the integrity of the download.
.. Set the file type, if necessary, with the `spec.dependencies.artifacts.type` field.
+
You should explicitly set the file type if it is not included in the URL or if the file type is actually different to the extension in the URL.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you set `type: file`, {ispn_operator} downloads the file as-is without extracting it to the filesystem.
