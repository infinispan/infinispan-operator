= Enabling client certificate authentication

[role="_abstract"]
{brandname} clusters do not use client certificate authentication by default.
Complete the following procedure to enable it.

You can configure {brandname} to verify client identities from certificates in a trust store in two ways:

`Validate`:: Requires a trust store that contains only the signing certificate, which is typically a Certificate Authority (CA). Any client that presents a certificate signed by the CA can connect to {brandname}.
`Authenticate`:: Requires a trust store that contains all client certificates in addition to the signing certificate. Only clients that present a signed certificate that is present in the trust store can connect to {brandname}.

.Procedure

. Set either `Validate` or `Authenticate` as the value for the `spec.security.endpointEncryption.clientCert` field in your `Infinispan` CR.
+
[NOTE]
====
The default value is `None`.
====
+
. Specify the secret that contains the client trust store with the `spec.security.endpointEncryption.clientCertSecretName` field.
+
By default {ispn_operator} expects a trust store secret named `<cluster-name>-client-cert-secret`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The secret must be unique to each `Infinispan` CR instance in the {k8s} cluster.
When you delete the `Infinispan` CR, {k8s} also automatically deletes the associated secret.

. Apply the changes.

.Next steps

Provide {ispn_operator} with a trust store that contains all client certificates.
Alternatively you can provide certificates in PEM format and let {brandname} generate a client trust store.
