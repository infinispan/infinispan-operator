= Installing {ispn_operator} on {openshift}
Create subscriptions to {ispn_operator} on {openshiftshort} so you can install
different {brandname} versions and receive automatic updates.

Automatic updates apply to {ispn_operator} first and then for each {brandname}
node.
{ispn_operator} updates clusters one node at a time, gracefully shutting
down each node and then bringing it back online with the updated version before
going on to the next node.

.Prerequisites
