= Installing {ispn_operator} on {openshift}
Create subscriptions to {ispn_operator} on {openshiftshort} so you can install
different {brandname} versions and receive automatic updates.

.Prerequisites

* Access to **OperatorHub** running on {openshiftshort}. Some {openshiftshort} environments, such as {ocp}, can require administrator credentials.
* An {openshiftshort} project for {ispn_operator}.

.Procedure

. Log in to the {osweb}.
. Navigate to **OperatorHub**.
. Find and select {ispn_operator}.
. Select **Install** and continue to **Create Operator Subscription**.
. Specify options for your subscription.
+
Installation Mode:: Install {ispn_operator} into a specific {openshiftshort} namespace. You cannot install {ispn_operator} into multiple namespaces.
Update Channel:: Subscribe to updates for {ispn_operator} versions.
Approval Strategies:: When new {brandname} versions become available, you can install updates manually or let {ispn_operator} install them automatically.
+
[NOTE]
====
Automatic updates apply to {ispn_operator} first and then for each {brandname}
node. {ispn_operator} updates clusters one node at a time, gracefully shutting
down each node and then bringing it back online with the updated version before
going on to the next node.
