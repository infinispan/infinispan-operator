= Restarting {brandname} Clusters

* Set the value of `replicas` to the same number of pods that were in the
cluster before you shut it down.

For example, you shut down a cluster of 6 pods. When you restart the cluster,
you must set:

----
spec:
  replicas: 6
----

This allows {brandname} to restore the distribution of data across the cluster.
When all pods in the cluster are running, you can then add or remove pods.
