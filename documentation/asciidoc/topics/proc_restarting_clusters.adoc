= Restarting {brandname} clusters
Complete the following procedure to restart {brandname} clusters after shutdown.

.Prerequisites

For {datagridservice} nodes, you must restart clusters with the same number of
nodes before shutdown. For example, you shut down a cluster of 6 nodes. When
you restart that cluster, you must specify 6 as the value for `spec.replicas`.

This allows {brandname} to restore the distribution of data across the cluster.
When all nodes in the cluster are running, you can then add or remove nodes.

You can find the correct number of nodes for {brandname} clusters as follows:

[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
$ {oc_get_infinispan} {example_crd_name} -o=jsonpath='{.status.replicasWantedAtRestart}'
----

.Procedure

* Set the value of `spec.replicas` to the appropriate number of nodes for your cluster, for example:
+
----
spec:
  replicas: 6
