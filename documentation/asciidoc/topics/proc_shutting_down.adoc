= Shutting down {brandname} clusters
Shutting down {cacheservice} nodes removes all data in the cache. For
{datagridservice} nodes, you should configure the storage size for
{datagridservice} nodes to ensure that the persistent volume can hold all your
data.

If the available container storage is less than the amount of memory available
to {datagridservice} nodes, {brandname} writes the following exception to logs
and data loss occurs during shutdown:

----
WARNING: persistent volume size is less than memory size. Graceful shutdown may not work.
