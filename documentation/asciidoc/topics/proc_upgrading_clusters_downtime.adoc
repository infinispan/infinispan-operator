= Upgrading {brandname} clusters with downtime

[role="_abstract"]
Upgrading {brandname} clusters with downtime results in service disruption but does not require any additional capacity.

.Prerequisites

* If required, configure a persistent cache store to preserve your data during the upgrade.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
At the start of the upgrade process {ispn_operator} shuts down your existing cluster.
This results in data loss if you do not configure a persistent cache store.
====

.Procedure

. Ensure that `Shutdown` is set as the value for the `spec.upgrades.type` field, which is the default.

. Apply your changes, if necessary.

When it detects a new {brandname} version, {ispn_operator} automatically upgrades your cluster or prompts you to manually approve the upgrade before proceeding.
