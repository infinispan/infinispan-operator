= Performing Hot Rod rolling upgrades for {brandname} clusters

[role="_abstract"]
Performing Hot Rod rolling upgrades lets you move to a new {brandname} version without service disruption.
However, this upgrade type requires additional capacity and temporarily results in two {brandname} clusters with different versions running concurrently.

.Prerequisite

* The {ispn_operator} version you have installed supports the {brandname} target version.

.Procedure

. Specify the {brandname} version number in the `spec.version` field.
. Specify `HotRodRolling` as the value for the `spec.upgrades.type` field.
