= Using Custom Credentials Secrets
{ispn_operator} requires that credentials exist as values for the `username`
and `password` keys in a secret. If you have a custom secret that contains
{brandname} credentials, but uses different key names, you can override those
names in your `Cache` CR.

For example, you have a secret named "my-credentials" that holds a list of
{brandname} users and their passwords as follows:

[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
stringData:
  app_user1: spock
  app_user1_pw: G8ZdJvSaY3lOOwfM
  app_user2: jim
  app_user2_pw: zTzz2gVyyF4JsYsH
----

.Procedure

* In your `Cache` CR, override custom key names with `username` and `password` as follows:

[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
spec:
  adminAuth:
    username:
      key: app_user1 <1>
      name: my-credentials <2>
    password:
      key: app_user1_pw <3>
      name: my-credentials
----

<1> Overrides the `app_user1` key name with `username`.
<2> Specifies the name of your custom credentials secret.
<3> Overrides the `app_user1_pw` key name with `password`.
