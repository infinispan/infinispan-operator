== Handling failed operations

If the `status.phase` field of the `Backup` or `Restore` CR is `Failed`, you should do the following:

. Examine the logs for the pod that performed the failed operation.
+
Pods are terminated but remain available until you delete the `Backup` or `Restore` CR.
+
[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
$ {oc_logs} <backup|restore_pod_name>
----
+
. Resolve any error conditions or other causes of failure as indicated by the pod logs.
. Create a new instance of the `Backup` or `Restore` CR and attempt the operation again.
