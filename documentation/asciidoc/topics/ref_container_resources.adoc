= JVM, CPU, and Memory Resources

<1> Specifies JVM options.
<2> Allocates host CPU resources to node, measured in CPU units.
<3> Allocates host memory resources to nodes, measured in bytes.

When {ispn_operator} creates {brandname} clusters, it uses `spec.container.cpu`
and `spec.container.memory` to:

* Ensure that {k8s} has sufficient capacity to run the {brandname} node. By
default {ispn_operator} requests **512Mi** of `memory` and **0.5** `cpu` from
the {k8s} scheduler.
* Constrain node resource usage. {ispn_operator} sets the values of `cpu` and
`memory` as resource limits.

.Garbage collection logging
By default, {ispn_operator} does not log garbage collection (GC) messages.
You can optionally add the following JVM options to direct GC messages to
stdout:
