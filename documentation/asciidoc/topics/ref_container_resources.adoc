= JVM, CPU, and Memory Resources

<1> specifies JVM options.
<2> allocates host CPU resources to pods, measured in CPU units.
<3> allocates host memory resources to pods, measured in bytes.

When {ispn_operator} creates {brandname} pods, it uses `spec.container.cpu` and `spec.container.memory` to:

* Ensure that {k8s} nodes have sufficient capacity to run the pods. The
{ispn_operator} uses `memory`, but only half the value of `cpu`, as resource
requests to the {k8s} scheduler.
* Constrain pod resource usage. The {ispn_operator} sets the values of `cpu`
and `memory` as resource limits.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot modify JVM options or CPU and memory resources after you create
{brandname} pods. In this case you must delete the existing {brandname} pods
and create new ones.

.Garbage collection logging
By default, the {ispn_operator} does not log garbage collection (GC) messages.
You can optionally add the following JVM options to direct GC messages to
stdout:
