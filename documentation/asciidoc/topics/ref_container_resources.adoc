|Field
|Description

|`spec.container.extraJvmOpts`
|Specifies JVM options.

|`spec.container.cpu`
|Allocates host CPU resources to {brandname} nodes, measured in CPU units.

|`spec.container.memory`
|Allocates host memory to {brandname} nodes, measured in bytes.

|===

When {ispn_operator} creates {brandname} clusters, it uses `spec.container.cpu` and `spec.container.memory` to:

* Ensure that {k8s} has sufficient capacity to run the {brandname} node. By
default {ispn_operator} requests **512Mi** of `memory` and **0.5** `cpu` from
the {k8s} scheduler.
* Constrain node resource usage. {ispn_operator} sets the values of `cpu` and
`memory` as resource limits.
