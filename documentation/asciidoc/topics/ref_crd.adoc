= Infinispan Custom Resource (CR)
{ispn_operator} adds a new Custom Resource (CR) of type **Infinispan** that lets
you handle {brandname} clusters as complex units on {k8s}.

{ispn_operator} watches for **Infinispan** Custom Resources (CR) that you use to
instantiate and configure {brandname} clusters and manage {k8s} resources, such
as StatefulSets and Services. In this way, the **Infinispan** CR is your
primary interface to {brandname} on {k8s}.

The minimal **Infinispan** CR is as follows:

[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]

include::yaml_annotated/cr_minimal.yaml[]
----

<1> Declares the Infinispan API version.
<2> Declares the Infinispan CR.
<3> Names the {brandname} cluster.
<4> Specifies the number of nodes in the {brandname} cluster.
