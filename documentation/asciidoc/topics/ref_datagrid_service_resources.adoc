|Field
|Description

|`metadata.name`
|Names your {brandname} cluster.

|`metadata.annotations.infinispan.org/monitoring`
|Automatically creates a `ServiceMonitor` for your cluster.

|`spec.replicas`
|Specifies the number of pods in your cluster.

|`spec.version`
| Specifies the {brandname} Server version of your cluster.

|`spec.upgrades.type`
|Controls how {ispn_operator} upgrades your {brandname} cluster when new versions become available.

|`spec.service.type`
|Configures the type {brandname} service. A value of `DataGrid` creates a cluster with {datagridservice} pods.

|`spec.service.container`
|Configures the storage resources for {datagridservice} pods.

|`spec.service.sites`
|Configures cross-site replication.

|`spec.security.endpointSecretName`
|Specifies an authentication secret that contains {brandname} user credentials.

|`spec.security.endpointEncryption`
|Specifies TLS certificates and keystores to encrypt client connections.

|`spec.container`
|Specifies JVM, CPU, and memory resources for {brandname} pods.

|`spec.logging`
|Configures {brandname} logging categories.

|`spec.expose`
|Controls how {brandname} endpoints are exposed on the network.

|`spec.configMapName`
|Specifies a `ConfigMap` that contains {brandname} configuration.

|`spec.configListener.enabled`
|Creates a `listener` pod in each {brandname} cluster that allows {ispn_operator} to reconcile server-side modifications with {brandname} resources such as the `Cache` CR.

The `listener` pod consumes minimal resources and is enabled by default.
Setting a value of `false` removes the `listener` pod and disables bi-directional reconciliation.
You should do this only if you do not need declarative Kubernetes representations of {brandname} resources created through the {brandname} Console, CLI, or client applications.

|`spec.configListener.logging.level`
|Configures the logging level for the `ConfigListener` deployments. The default level is `info`. You can change it to `debug` or  `error`.

|`spec.scheduling.affinity`
|Configures anti-affinity strategies that guarantee {brandname} availability.
