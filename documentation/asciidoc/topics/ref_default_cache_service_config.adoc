{cacheservice} nodes use the following cache configuration:

[source,xml,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
include::config_examples/cache_service_default_cache.xml[]
----

<1> Names the cache instance as "default".
<2> Uses synchronous distribution for storing data across the cluster.
<3> Configures one replica for each cache entry across the cluster.
<4> Stores cache entries as bytes in native memory (off-heap).
<5> Removes old entries to make space when adding new entries.
<6> Specifies a conflict resolution strategy that allows read and write operations for cache entries even if segment owners are in different partitions.
<7> Specifies a merge policy that removes entries from the cache when {brandname} detects conflicts.
