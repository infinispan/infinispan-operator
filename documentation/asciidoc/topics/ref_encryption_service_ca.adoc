= Encryption with {openshift} Service Certificates
{ispn_operator} automatically generates TLS certificates that are signed by the
{openshift} service CA. {ispn_operator} then stores the certificates and keys
in a secret so you can retrieve them and use with remote clients.

If the {openshift} service CA is available, {ispn_operator} adds the following
`spec.security.endpointEncryption` configuration to the **Infinispan** CR:

[source,options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
----
spec:
  ...
  security:
    endpointEncryption:
      type: Service
      certServiceName: service.beta.openshift.io <1>
      certSecretName: {example_crd_name}-cert-secret <2>
----

<1> Specifies the {openshift} Service.
<2> Names the secret that contains a service certificate, `tls.crt`, and key, `tls.key`, in PEM format. If you do not specify a name, {ispn_operator} uses `<cluster_name>-cert-secret`.

[NOTE]
====
Service certificates use the internal DNS name of the {brandname} cluster as the common name (CN), for example:

`Subject: CN = example-infinispan.mynamespace.svc`

For this reason, service certificates can be fully trusted only inside
{openshiftshort}. If you want to encrypt connections with clients running
outside {openshiftshort}, you should use custom TLS certificates.

Service certificates are valid for one year and are automatically replaced
before they expire.
