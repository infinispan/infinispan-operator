= Naming Requirements for Backup Locations
{ispn_operator} expects {brandname} cluster names and namespaces at each backup
location to be identical.

For example, at the **LON** site you create a {brandname} cluster with
`metadata.name: mydatagrid` in a {k8s} project named "my-xsite". To use a
{brandname} cluster at the **NYC** site as a backup for **LON**, you must
create that cluster with an identical name in an identical namespace.
