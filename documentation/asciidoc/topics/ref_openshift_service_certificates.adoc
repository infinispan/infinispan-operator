= {openshift} Service Certificates
If the {openshift} service CA is available, {ispn_operator} automatically
generates a certificate, `tls.crt`, and key, `tls.key`, in PEM format.

[NOTE]
====
Service certificates use the internal DNS name of the {brandname} cluster as the common name (CN), for example:

`Subject: CN = example-infinispan.mynamespace.svc`

For this reason, service certificates can be fully trusted only inside
{openshiftshort}. If you want to encrypt connections with clients running
outside {openshiftshort}, you should use custom TLS certificates.
====

Certificates are valid for one year and are automatically replaced before they
expire.
