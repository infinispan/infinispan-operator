By default, {cacheservice} deployments use partition handling to ensure data
consistency.

* `ALLOW_READ_WRITES` conflict resolution strategy that allows read and write operations for cache entries even if the owners of a segment are in different partitions.
* `REMOVE_ALL` merge policy that removes entries from the cache when conflicts are detected.

[NOTE]
====
Network partitioning applies only when data is replicated across a cluster.
