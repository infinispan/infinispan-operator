By default, {cacheservice} deployments use partition handling to ensure data
consistency.

* `DENY_READ_WRITES` conflict resolution strategy that denies read and write operations for cache entries unless all the owners of a segment are in the same partition.
* `REMOVE_ALL` merge policy that removes entries from the cache when conflicts are detected.

[NOTE]
====
Network partitioning applies only when data is replicated across a cluster.
