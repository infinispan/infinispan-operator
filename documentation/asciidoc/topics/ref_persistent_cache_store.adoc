[role="_abstract"]
{ispn_operator} creates a persistent volume claim (PVC) and mounts container storage at: +
`{pv_path}`

.Caches
When you create caches, {brandname} permanently stores their configuration so your caches are available after cluster restarts.
This applies to both {cacheservice} and {datagridservice} nodes.

.Data
Data is always volatile in clusters of {cacheservice} nodes.
When you shutdown the cluster, you permanently lose the data.

Use a file-based cache store, by adding the `<file-store/>` element to your {brandname} cache configuration, if you want {datagridservice} nodes to persist data during cluster shutdown.
