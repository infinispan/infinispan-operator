<2> authentication secrets must be `Opaque`.
<3> contains application users in `YAML` format.

* You must include the `operator` user and specify a password. The {ispn_operator}

* Do not use example passwords from this documentation. You should always replace
example credentials with ones that conform to the relevant security guidelines.
