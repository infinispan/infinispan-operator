= Supported versions

[role="_abstract"]
Since version 2.3.0 {ispn_operator} supports multiple {brandname} Server versions.
You can upgrade the version of your cluster between supported {brandname} versions:

include::supported_operands/operand_table.adoc[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Operand versions `15.1.0` and `15.1.1` should be skipped when upgrading from the `15.0.x` stream, 
due to https://github.com/infinispan/infinispan/issues/13519[#13519] which may cause issues if invalidation caches are present or if attempting to restore from backups created with prior Infinispan versions.
