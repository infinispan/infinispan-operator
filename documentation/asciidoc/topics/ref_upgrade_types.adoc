|`HotRodRolling`
|Upgrades {brandname} clusters without downtime. {ispn_operator} creates a new {brandname} cluster with the target version and uses a remote store to copy data from the existing cluster. During the upgrade {ispn_operator} also redirects all clients to the new cluster. When it completes the upgrade process, {ispn_operator} removes the old {brandname} cluster.
| Doesn't require persistence in caches, but when using persistence, should not be used if any cache has passivation enabled.
|`Shutdown`
|Upgrades {brandname} clusters with downtime. {ispn_operator} shuts down the existing cluster before removing it, then creates a new cluster with the target version. This is the default upgrade type.
| Data is lost if caches don't have a store, service disruption while migration takes place.
