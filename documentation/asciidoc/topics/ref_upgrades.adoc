== Upgrade notes

If you upgrade {brandname} clusters manually and have upgraded the channel for your {ispn_operator} subscription from **2.0.x** to **2.1.x** you should apply the upgrade for the latest {brandname} 12.x version as soon as possible.
This upgrade avoids potential data loss that can occur in earlier versions with link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ISPN-13116[ISPN-13116].
