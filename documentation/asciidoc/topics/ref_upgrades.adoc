[role="_abstract"]

== Upgrade notes

If you upgrade {brandname} clusters manually, you should upgrade to the latest {brandname} 12.x version if you have already upgraded {ispn_operator} from 2.0.x to 2.1.x, which corresponds to {brandname} Server 11.x to 12.x.

You should perform this upgrade as soon as possible to avoid potential data loss that can occur after upgrading to {brandname} 12.1.0 through to 12.1.4 from an earlier {brandname} version.
