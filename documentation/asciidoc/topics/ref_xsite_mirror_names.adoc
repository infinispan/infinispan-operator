= {brandname} Cluster and Project Naming
{ispn_operator} expects {brandname} clusters in each site to have the same
cluster names and be running in matching namespaces.

For example, in the **LON** site you create a {brandname} cluster with
`metadata.name: mydatagrid` in a {k8s} project named "my-xsite". In this case
you must create {brandname} clusters in other backup locations, such as
**NYC**, with identical names in matching namespaces.

In effect, you must create {brandname} cluster names and {k8s} namespaces at
each backup location that mirror one another.
